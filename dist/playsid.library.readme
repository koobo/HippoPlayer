This version of playsid.library provides three different sound
output methods:

- The original SID emulation by Per Sundell & Ron Birk (kick 1.3, 68000)
- The reSID emulation engine by Dag Lem (68060 or similar)
- SIDBlaster-USB, a device that uses a SID chip for sound (kick 2.0+, 68020)

To use, copy "playsid.library" into LIBS:, replacing the original
version. By default it will use the original SID emulation mode.

Applications using "playsid.library" will automatically be enhanced.
These are at least: PlaySID, HippoPlayer, DeliTracker, Magic64, Frodo. 
HippoPlayer also provides additional integration in the user interface.


Configuring with environment variables
--------------------------------------
- Set operating mode: normal/classic mode, reSID 6581, reSID 8580, 
  reSID auto detect or SIDBlaster USB
  Variable: "PlaySIDMode", values: "Norm,6581,8580,Auto,Sidb"

- Set reSID mode: normal, oversample 2x, 3x, 4x
  Variable: "PlaySIDreSIDMode", values: "Norm,Ovs2,Ovs3,Ovs4"

- Enable: reSID AHI output by specifying the AHI mode identifier:
  Variable: "PlaySIDreSIDAHI", value: 8-digit hex number

- Set reSID output volume boost
  Variable: "PlaySIDreSIDBoost", values: "0,1,2,3,4"

- Toggle reSID filter settings, internal on, internal+external on, both off
  Variable: "PlaySIDreSIDFilter", values: "onIn,on,off"

- Toggle reSID debug colors:
  Variable: "PlaySIDDebug", values: "on,off"


reSID
-----

reSID provides an accurate, cycle exact emulation of both the 6581 
and the 8580 SID chips, with filter support. 

reSID is very heavy on the CPU. Depending on the tune and settings, 
it will use half or more of the available CPU power on an A1200 with a 
50MHz 68060. An FPU is not required.

In reSID mode the library is able to play stereo SIDs (2SID),
outputting six SID channels.

Sometimes the sound output may be noisy. This is sampling noise, 
result of the reSID "fast sampling" method. A few other sampling
modes are also available to reduce the noise. 

If the tune being played and/or the chosen sampling mode is too 
heavy, data will be skipped to avoid slowing down the system too much.
This will cause the sound to be distorted.

The filters can be enabled or disabled. The main filter is responsible
for the distinctive SID sound. The external filter does not have
much of an audible effect, it may reduce the sampling noise somewhat.

The sound is output using the Paula 14-bit mode.

'setenv PlaySIDDebug 1' will enable reSID raster bar CPU measurement visual, 0
will disable it.

SIDBlaster
----------

SIDBlaster is a USB device that can utilize an actual SID chip
and allow playback using it, providing a truly authentic sound. 

In addition to some extra hardware and USB connectivity, 
the Poseidon USB stack needs to be installed. 

Digisamples will not be heard. The playsid.library sample handling 
is not usable with SIDBlaster.

Changelog
---------
- 2022-10: Initial version, reSID v0.16
- 2022-11: SIDBlaster support, new reSID sampling modes, 
           reSID speed optimizations, some fixes
- 2022-11-19: Fix bug where playback would get stuck for a while, 
              example tune: JCH/Hawaii
- 2023-02   - Added support for 2SIDs, stereo SIDs with 6 audio
  v1.4        channels. This works only in reSID mode, and takes about
              double the amount of CPU compared to ordinary SIDs.
            - Full support for multispeed tunes added, earlier only
              speeds up to four worked properly.
            - A bunch of reSID speed optimizations, enabling 
              the heavier Oversample x2 and x3 modes to with most
              tunes on 50MHz 060. About 20% faster compared
              to previous.
- 2023-03   - Add AHI support for reSID output.
  v1.5      - Fix hang and crash bug which could happen when 
              starting playback.
            - Fix another crash bug related to earlier reSID  
              modifications.
- 2023-11   - Improved SIDBlaster support, faster and more stable.
  v1.6        Lower CPU requirement than before, works on 68020.
            - Support for digisample playback with reSID, as 
              heard in "Skate or Die" or "Arkanoid", for example.
              NOTE: Digisamples not supported in AHI mode.
            - Fix volume setting so that it also changes the 
              digisample volume in the original mode.
            - Add support for reSID volume boost.
            - Library compatible with kick 1.3.
            - Allow "Oversample" modes to work with AHI.
            - Enhanced environment variables for more control.
