- On the buttons it now says "VonBeat" (without "SYS:" or so)
- Clicking "Add" to add a module, the path can be found --> works as expected:
- But clicking "Prg" to load a program I get a directory error:
--> the default path for programs needs a full path (like "SYS:VonBeat") 
to work correctly, which is not the case when just selecting a dir, which is the most forward thing to do

FIXED: TODO:
"possible" bug found, perhaps an old one rather than recent? used the HVSC
search to look for "MEGA APOC", to find Mega Apocalypse tunes, 4 show up, of
those 4, the topmost DAZZ/Mega Apocalypse Remix tune works as does the bottm
MC/Mega Apocalypse tune, the middle 2 however error out and skip. so the first
problem here is that 2 of those files are not recognised as sid music tunes,
confirmed by manually aquiring the files and trying to load them, they say
unknown format and ask you to remove from list/etc, the 2nd entry is the
official rob hubbard sid tune, so surprised that one doesnt get recognised tbh
(Delitracker and Eagleplayer also fails to recognise it). 

second problem is that if i play the above 2 tunes that DO work, then thats
fine, they download/load/play no issue, but now those 2 non working ones in the
search list? if i start with the official rob hubbard tune, it loads/fails to
play and hippo says "Skipping", it skips to Mac EK/Mega Apocalypse, which also
isnt recognised and that file skips as well, skips to the last in the list which
is the previously working MC/Mega Apocalypse, which now however locks up my
emulated system completely. So starting with 2 not recognised files which then
skip down the list to a known working one causes an emulated system lockup
(Tested on FS-UAE) when it eventually tries to play the previous working sid
tune.

  I think in random play mode it should only play first song, since some have quite a

- set random play

FIXED: GFX GLITCH
- minify window with RMB+Pr
--> top part of favorites button is visible

FIXED: SCOPE BUG: activation
- the scope works in multimonitor support as long as ALL modules that are played
  support it. Once a module that doesn't support the scope is loaded
  the next module that supports it does not enable it anymore.
  So if you play modules in random order as soon as a 
  module that doesn't support visualization is played the scope
  stops working all together (until you click on the scope of course).

Would it be possible to add an option for the Scopes to update at all times regardless if the screen is active or not?
